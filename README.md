# APPLICATIONS-OF-PYTHON-IN-DEMAND-FORECAST

## I. Introduction
Demand Forecast is essentially an important factor in business which allows corporations to be capable of making right decisions, which eventually reduces several types of risk, manages the cash flows, or even increases the profitability. Without a profound understanding of demand, business leaders will not be able to determine any strategic plans from marketing to finance. Even though there will never be 100 percent accuracy in demand forecasting, a solid forecast can still be able to depict future customers’ behaviors; hence, give a better idea for inventory as well as a pricing strategy.

## II. Questions to answer:
Since the demand forecast is important to any commercial organizations, our group would like to introduce a method in which we utilize Python to perform some demand predictions that will provide thorough business insights that would be helpful for a specific business.
Using a chosen data set (details in III), we will answer the following questions:

- 1. Main question: Provide a 3-month demand forecast for the total sale as precisely as possible.
- a. Sub question 1: Which product (or which SKU) will be the most demanding in the next three
months?
- b. Sub question 2: A weekly total sales and a specific product’s sale
- c. Sub question 3: Is seasonal sales important to this business? If yes, what is the pattern of sales and how to increase the sales based on the demand forecast?

## III. Data:
The data we use to guide our demand prediction was originally provided by an online electronics retailer. For confidential purposes, before giving data to us, they have anonymized the data and performed a series of slight modifications. The data set reports the weekly sales of a technology e-commerce retailer over a period of 100
weeks, from October 2016 to September 2018. The data set includes the weekly sales of 44 items, also called SKU, and other information on these SKUs. The raw data consists of a collection of isolated transactions. Specifically, each row in the data set correspond to a specific transaction that includes SKUs’ features (color, brand, size), customer’ information, price, store, etc. Given this data set, we will be processing the data by finding missing value (eg: NaN value), outliers, etc, providing some statistical descriptions, and training predictive models.
